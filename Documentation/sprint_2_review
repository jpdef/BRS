Actions to stop doing:
    -nothing for this sprint

Actions to start doing:
    -The team should confirm meetings ahead of time to ensure attendance, since some meetings were missing some members
    -The team should utilize GIT more, and frequently update working code as finished,since not having current code hindered some portions of lab
